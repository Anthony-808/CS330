How do I approach designing software?

For this project, I approached design by breaking the work into small, isolated pieces and focusing on the function of each component individually. Because large parts of the program were already implemented by an existing codebase, I began by forming an understanding how and where new functionality was meant to fit. This helped me develop design skills centered on modularity and separation of concerns, which I can use whenever working on any collaborative project. 

How I approach developing programs:

In developing the 3D scene, I learned how to work inside a large codebase. I do so by implementing the needed functionality with minimal changes, then refactoring the code to make it  cleaner and easier to maintain. A lot of iteration was involved in this process.Over the milestones, I became more organized and intentional with my code structure instead of just getting features to work.

How computer science helps me reach my goals:

Computational graphics gave me insight into how everyday visual output is generated behind the scenes, which strengthens my understanding for future courses. Professionally, the skills I practiced: working within large systems, organizing code, and separating concerns, can be applied to any coding projects.
